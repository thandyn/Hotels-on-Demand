# Hotels-On-Demand

## project-1

## Description

This application will help the user that is traveling find a hotel for their desired location. This application will also allow the user to see what the best food options are near that hotel. For this application we incorporated two API's with one used to find a hotel by city and the second used to find nearby resturants to that hotel. The user will be able to find where they can stay and where they can eat in this one application.

## Usage

The user will be able to use the application to find a hotel in the city they are traveling too. They will also be able to see what resturants there are around that hotel. This will make it easier for the user to know places they can eat when traveling as well as find a hotel that meets their needs.
